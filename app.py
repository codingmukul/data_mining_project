    3. **Seasonality**: There might be some **seasonal patterns**, as occasional spikes can be observed during certain periods (e.g., beginning of 2015). However, the patterns are not immediately obvious from this graph alone.
    4. **Sales Peaks**: There are noticeable spikes where sales exceed **90 items per day**. These may indicate specific events, promotions, or external factors influencing higher sales.
    5. **Steady Base Level**: Despite fluctuations, the daily sales hover mostly between **40 and 70 items per day**, suggesting a relatively stable baseline demand.
